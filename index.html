            <p> Graduating from the University of Houston-Downtown with a Bachelor in Interdisciplinary Studies and minors in Communication and Computer Science was not the path I initially envisioned. For years, I struggled to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. It wasn't until I took a Python course in my junior year, at the age of 25, that I discovered my passion for coding. That course iginited a spark, leading me to pursue a Computer Science minor and dive in to programming. </p>
            <p>Since then, I've developed strong skills in C++, Pyhton, and SQL, building a soild foundation in software development and database management. Currently, I'm focused on frontend development, learning HTML, CSS, and React to create user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. I love problem-solving and tranforming ideas into reality through code.</p>
            <P>I aspire to become a software engineer,specializing in frontend development, where I can use my knowledge and skills to desigin a intitive user interfaces that provide seamless user experiences. By combining my strong technical background with my ongoing learning in frontend technologies, I am excited to contribute to innovative projects and contince growing as a developer in the tech industry.</p>
